This is basically a simple sh botnet where you can execute commands on target once yuo connect to it through script you can remove some part and make a 
list for targets so right now it works on only one target but changing it to use it for multiple target(this what a truly botnet is)
is extremely easy just instead of using one target create a list and lopp through it send targets one by one to functions
